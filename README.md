### Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science educator and a graduate student in the Master of Information Systems program.  
My background in teaching and theory gives me a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals.

Right now, I'm learning full-stack development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), focusing on Ruby on Rails and modern web technologies.  
I'm interested in building practical projects that connect academic knowledge with real-world development.
